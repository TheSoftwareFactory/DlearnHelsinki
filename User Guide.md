The larger the surface area colored in the graph, the better the results are.

## Managing Groups  
To manage groups, go to group management. 
If there are no groups, create the first group by clicking the button that says "Add a group", giving the group a name and confirming by clicking the "Confirm" button. You can create as many groups as you want/need.
To delete a group, click the button "Delete a group", select the group you wish to delete, and click "Confirm". **Note that you can only delete groups that are empty!** If a group you wish to delete has students in it, move the students to another group first.
To move a student to another group, select a student from a group, you will get a popup with the student's information. Then, select a new group for the student from the popup's dropdown menu and finish by clicking the button that says "Change group".

## Creating New Students
Creating students happens through the Group Management. 
After creating the desired amount of groups (at least one), click on the button with a plus(+)-sign on it to enter student creation. Then, fill in the fields in the popup as instucted and click the button on the popup to finish.
Currently, student account information doesn't transfer between classes, so there is no way to add an existing student from another class into a group. If you wish to add a new student into a group, you have to create a new account for them, even if the student already has an account in the app created for them by another teacher, or by you but in a different class.
There is also no way to delete existing student accounts in the current version.

## Changing A Student's Password
Should a student forget their password, there is no way to recover it. A teacher can, however assign a student a new password.
To do so, go to group management and click on the student's name. On the popup, there is a password field. Fill in, or have the student fill in a new password and click on "Reset password".
